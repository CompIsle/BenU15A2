            <p> I joined Hot Beans in 2022 as a trainee after becoming interested in web development.
                It was a surpise for me to learn about all the small and important decidions that go into making a professional website and learning how to make them in my own designs.
                Eventually, I was able make websites that look unique and professional.
                I am also continuing to hone my skills as a web designer.

            <p> I joined Hot Beans in 2023 as a trainee as I just liked the idea of designing and building websites.
                Learning and managing my new responsibilities as professional website design and meeting project deadlines was the hardest part at first, but as I settled into the company I was able to handle tasks easier.
